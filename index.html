        <hr>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>This game does not have keyboard+mouse support, you can only really move up and down and to the sides but no shooting.</p>
        <p>I know it's wierd, but I'm the website guy, not the dev.</p>
        <p>Currently the game is really wierd with keyboard, so use a controller.</p>
        <h2>The game is ONLY OUT FOR WINDOWS SO FAR</h2>
        <hr>
        <h2>Controller Support Guide</h2>
        <p>Xbox: Perfect support</p>
        <p>Playstation: Mostly playable</p>
        <p>Nintendo Switch: Untested</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>More notes on Playstation controllers</h2>
        <p>At the moment, Playstation controllers are not great</p>
        <p>When it says to click start, it's to click the left or right joystick. I don't know which one.</p>
        <p>You cannot switch weapons unless you are collecting one.</p>
