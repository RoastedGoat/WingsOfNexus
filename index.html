        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>This game does not have keyboard+mouse support, you can only really move up and down and to the sides but no shooting.</p>
        <p>I know it's wierd, but I'm the website guy, not the dev.</p>
        <p>I don't know if it supports other controllers like Nintendo or Playstation controllers but I do know it supports Xbox controllers.</p>
        <p>Controllers only.</p>
